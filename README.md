Project in the course 'Bioinformatics for Translational Medicine' for predicting breast cancer subtypes HER2+, HR+, Triple Neg based on ArrayCGH data of 100 patients using machine learning.

# Abstract 

Machine learning can be used to create predictive models that analyse patient data and provide information about disease genotypes. In breast cancer, correct prediction of the molecular sub-type can improve treatment. In this study, breast cancer patient data (Array CGH) was used to train models using Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Naive Bayes. Since ANNs are relatively new in machine learning, in this report it is  evaluated whether a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), a form of ANN, proved more successful compared to Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifiers. The MLP model resulted in an accuracy of 85\% as compared to an accuracy of the other models of 76\% and 81\% respectively. Even though this is an improvement, it would still not be sufficient to be applied in practice. More accurate predictive models could aid doctors in providing patients with personalised medicine, improving treatment quality and quality of life.
